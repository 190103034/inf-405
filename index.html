          <div>
            <p>
              Financial literacy is the ability to understand and effectively
              use various financial skills, including personal financial
              management, budgeting, and investing. Financial literacy is the
              foundation of your relationship with money, and it is a lifelong
              journey of learning. The earlier you start, the better off you
              will be because education is the key to success when it comes to
              money.

          <h2 class="section-title">Why is it important?</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              Financial literacy is important because it equips us with the
              knowledge and skills we need to manage money effectively. Without
              it, our financial decisions and the actions we take—or don’t
              take—lack a solid foundation for success. And this can have dire
              consequences:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The number of people with credit debt has increased by 28% since
                2020
              </li>
              <li>
                Only 36% of Kazakhstan's population are financially literate
              </li>
              <li>Most of the people cannot afford an emergence expense</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <h2 class="section-title">Why is it low?</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              There are many subtle reasons as to why financial literacy is low.
              But one of the main reasons is the overall low level of education
              in the society.

            <p class="product__description">
              A first and critical step when managing your money is to take a
              look at your finances and make a budget. A budget is a great tool
              to help you figure out what you’re spending your money on every
              month. If you don’t know how much money is coming in and going
              out, it can be easy to neglect savings and overspend.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are a variety of money tools available to help you better
              navigate your finances and make your life less complicated.
              Personal finance apps are designed to help you optimize your
              spending and savings choices each month. When you input all your
              financial commitments into a money management app, you’ll see your
              financial choices and habits more clearly. A money tool can help
              you keep track of your spending, budget and income, organize your
              expenses, and send you payment reminders.

            <p class="product__description">
              Knowing your credit score and the impact of good and bad credit is
              a helpful piece of your financial picture. Whether it’s renting an
              apartment, buying a car, or getting a loan, your credit rating can
              affect your ability to purchase or lease items. Each of the three
              main credit agencies, Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion, lets you
              check your credit free of charge once a year. Other services, like
              those offered through your bank, or companies like Credit Karma,
              regularly update your credit score, let you know who is inquiring
              about your credit, and offer information and advice on how to
              improve your rating.
